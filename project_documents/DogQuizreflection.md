# [Team name] Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 
* I followed it pretty closely, i had to change some of the design tables attributes, and i did not fully implement the last Patch endpoint.
I learned a lot about how to think about how to setup for the tables so that i could query easier.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked? 
* Research, Research, Research. My first line of defense was trying to problem solve my first/look at old projects and videos. Second was to search on google and chat gpt for help. Lastly was the teacher
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

## Scrum
I didnt do daily scrum because i had no team, but i can see the value to tell the team what you are doing and to keep direct communuication lines open.

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

## Looking ahead
I would look for more models. now that i know how the whole deployment process works of an application thinking about the steps to get it deployed makes  lot more sense.

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
